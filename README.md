### Hi there, I am Julen ðŸ‘‹

I am a researcher in the intersection of Robotics and Machine Learning. I aim to make household robotics true!

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently doing my Ph.D. at TU Darmstadt, advised by [Jan Peters](https://www.ias.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/Team/JanPeters).
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently researching in approaches to combine generative modelling algorithms and robotics.
- ðŸ¤– I am a Research Intern in Robotics group at Nvidia!! Let's make magic :D

ðŸ’¬ If it sounds like we might get along, [hit me up](mailto:julen@robot-learning.de).
